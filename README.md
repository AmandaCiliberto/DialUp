## Introduction

This is a super cool game that I did as the first project for my Ironhack bootcamp throughout the course of 1 week. The game is called 'Dial Up'. The project was to apply topics that we learned so far during the bootcamp, including HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## How to play
1. Buy the product on your shopping list.
2. Change channels on the TV to find the right product.
3. Turn the phone dial to choose a number.
4. Buy the right product before the timer runs out!
5. Be careful! Don't call the wrong number...
